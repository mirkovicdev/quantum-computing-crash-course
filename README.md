# Basic Quantum Mechanics for Quantum Computing

This repository contains a concise, math-first crash course in **basic quantum mechanics for quantum computing**.  
It is intended for students with a strong mathematics background but only introductory exposure to quantum physics.

ðŸ“„ **Content covered:**
- Refresher on SchrÃ¶dinger equation and observables  
- Dirac notation and Hilbert spaces  
- Qubits as two-level systems  
- Tensor product structure of multi-qubits  
- Pauli matrices and operator algebra  
- Unitary evolution and quantum gates  
- Projective measurements  
- Bloch sphere representation of qubits  
- Density matrices (pure vs mixed states, partial trace, thermal states)  
 
ðŸŽ¯ **Exercises:**  
The PDF ends with a set of progressively harder exercises, ranging from normalization and Pauli algebra to Bloch sphere dynamics, density matrix purity, and partial trace.
